# ðŸ“‘ ADR Index

This file tracks all **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for the Luna project.  
Each ADR captures a significant architectural or governance decision, its context, and its consequences.  

---

## ADR List

- **ADR-0000** â€” Template (do not modify)  
- **ADR-0001** â€” Establish Minimal Rust Core Skeleton (Draft)

---

## Conventions
- New ADRs must follow the template in `ADR-0000-template.md`.
- All ADRs should be sequentially numbered (`0001`, `0002`, etc.).
- Status of ADRs should be reflected here (e.g., Draft, Accepted, Superseded).
- Each ADR must link back to related **Decision Notes**, Issues, or PRs.
